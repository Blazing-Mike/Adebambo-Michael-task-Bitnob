   The world is gradually becoming a cashless society and in a society like this, there is a need for autonomy, privacy and anonymity.
Physical cash is not a practical alternative in our ever increasing digital world because people want to move value over the internet. We are then forced to seek electronic replacement that is equal to or better in utility and benefits - such as  preservation of one's autonomy, privacy, and anonymity - to cash.


Bitcoin, an electronic peer-to-peer, open, decentralized, and censorship-resistant Cryptocurrency is  designed for such a purpose. 
Though it is still yet to be fully privacy and anonymity preserving, it is getting closer to be with development techniques like **Taproot**.

## What is Taproot

Taproot is a soft fork that improves Bitcoin’s script to increase bitcoin’s scalability, privacy, and throughput rate while reducing fees and laying the foundation for upgrades in the future. It was proposed by Greg Maxwell in 2018 and officially activated on 14 November 2021
